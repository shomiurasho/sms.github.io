        <h1>Biography of The Smiths</h1>

        <h2 style="font-size:1.0em">
            <p>The Smiths were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982. 
                The band consisted of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, 
                bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. Critics have called 
                them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British 
                independent music scene of the 1980s. </p>
